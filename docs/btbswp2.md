# Environment Setup and the Command Line

*Environment Setup* is the process of organizing your computer so you can write code

This involves:
* Installing any necessary tools
* Configuring said tools
* Handling any hiccups in the process

There is no single setup process because everyone has a different computer with a different operating 
system, with different versions of that OS, with different versions of Python, and so on...
