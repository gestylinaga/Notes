# Introduction

## Book Conventions

- code won't always follow "best practices"

- focused on simplicity, not elegance

- for "quick and dirty" projects

## What is Programming?

### Programming

* the act of entering instructions for the computer to perform

- instructions can be to:

    - crunch numbers

    - modify text

    - look up information in files

    - communicate with other computers over the internet

* basic instructions:

    - "Do this; then do that."
    
    - "If this condition is true, perform this action;otherwise do that action."

    - "Do this action exactly 27 times.""

    - "Keep doing that action until this condition is true"

* these "instructions" refer to the **Source Code**

### What is Python

* Python, a programming language (with syntax rules for 'valid' Python code)

* The Python Interpreter, software that reads the source code and executes the 'instructions'

* name comes from British comedy group, not snake

    - Pythonistas

### Knowing Math

* programming doesn't necessarily mean needing to know a lot of math

    - think sudoku, based on numbers, but not really 'math'

    - sudoku puzzles can be broken down into individual steps/pieces

    - process of elimination/trial and error

* **Debugging** -- finding and fixing errors in code

    - writing programs involves breaking down problems into individual, detailed steps

    - observe what the program is doing, and find the cause of the bug


## About the book

1. First part covers basic Python Programming concepts

2. Second part covers various tasks your computer can automate

    - each chapter in part 2 has projects to study

* Appendix A: Installing third-party modules

    - pip or pip3 -- used to install python modules made outside of the core dev team

* Appendix B: Running Programs

* Appendix C: Answers to questions

* [Mu v1.10.0 -- editor software used in the book](https://codewith.mu/)

* IDLE -- Integrated Development and Learning Environment

    - comes packages with Python


> **Error Messages in Python:**
>
>> Traceback -- shows specific line and error
>>
>> TypeError -- describes type of error
    

## Asking Smart Programming Questions

- explain what you're trying to do, not just what you did

    - people can tell you if you're on the right track or not

- specify point of error

    - does it happen at the start?

    - only after certain actions?

- copy and paste *entire* error message into google

    - or [pastebin](https://pastebin.com)

    - or [gist.github](https://gist.github.com/)

    - or an email/any forum

- explain what you've already tried

    - shows you tried something

- list your python version

    - python 2 or 3

    - operating system important too

- if error happened after a change, explain the change

- be able to explain/reproduce error
