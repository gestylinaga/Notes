# Introduction

## Who Should Read this Book

Consider this a *sophmore* book, in that it is **not** a beginner tutorial, but instead a 
project-based continuation course

Projects are meant to appeal to anyone who wants to use programming to:
* Conduct experiments
* Test theories
* Simulate nature

Working through projects are meant to teach:
* Knowledge of Python libraries/modules
* Handy shortcuts
* Useful functions
* Helpful techniques

Instead of focusing on isolated modular code snippets, these projects teach you how to 
build complete, working programs involving real-world applications, datasets, and issues


## Why Python?

Python is a high-level, interpretive, general-purpose programming language:
* it's **Free** $$$
* highly interactive
* portable across all major platforms and microcontrollers (like the Raspberry Pi)
* supports both functional **and** object-oriented programming
* can interact with code written in other languages (like C++)

Because Python is accessible to beginners, and useful to experts, it is used in:
* Schools
* Universities
* Large corporations
* Financial institutions
* Most (if not all) fields of science

As a result, Python is the most popular language for:
* Machine learning
* Data science
* Artificial intelligence applications
