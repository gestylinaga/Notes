# History of Malware

"Malware" -- name comes from a mix of *malicious* and *software*

* designed to cause damage to computers or networks

* concept of malware has been around since 1949

    - first theories created by John von Neumann -- of von Neumann architecture


## The Creeper Program

* The **Creeper** Program -- aka "Creeper worm" or "Virus"

* by Bob Thomas in 1971 -- first-ever *virus* created

    - originally designed for "resource-sharing" between computers

* used **ARPANET** -- Advanced Research Projects Agency Network

* written in [PDP-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-10) Assembly language

* Affected [TENEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TENEX_(operating_system)) operating system

* Displayed "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!" on connected computer screen

    - not technically malware since it didn't cause any harm

* originally designed to remove older copies of itself before transferring to next computer

* redesigned by Ray Tomlinson to copy itself without deleting

    - possibly made it dangerous -- reinfecting the same computer multiple times

* named after a green ghoul on Scooby-doo

* **ARPANET**

    - created by the Network Working Group, formally calling it the *Network Control Program*

    - **Packet Switching** -- main data transfer method used in ARPANET

        + breaking data into packets to *route* or *send* to the receiver

        + the receiver reassembles the packets into whatever was sent


## Reaper

* created not long after Creeper

* by Ray Tomlinson -- who redesigned Creeper

* its purpose was to remove any copies or Creeper

* technically the first anti-virus

* API -- Application Programming Interface


## Wabbit

* written in 1974, one of the first *self-replicating* malware

* would reproduce so fast, system would choke on its own resources and crash

* first *malicious* malware

* couldn't pass via network, therefore not a *worm*

* can be classified as form of denial-of-service *fork bomb*

* worked by:

    - creating infinite loop that continually creates system processes to replicate

    - creates high number of CPU cycles
    
    - 'constipates' system, slowing down until it crashes

## ANIMAL

* written in 1975, first *Trojan* by John Walker

* subroutine *PERVADE*, would copy itself in backgroud while "fun game" would play

    - think Trojan horse from Greek history

* not malicious; halted by unintended OS upgrade

* ANIMAL coded in 1974, PERVADE added to it in 1975

## Elk Cloner

* coded by 15-year-old Richard Skrenta in 1982 as a joke

    - took him 2 weeks in assembly language

* first microcomputer virus that spread outside of a lab -- aka *in the wild*

* Boot Sector Virus -- infect boot sector; infect every disc inserted into computer

    - waited until 50th succesful boot, then would boot to a poem instead

* Affected: Apple II operating sytem; Apple DOS disks


## The Morris Internet Worm

* released in 1988 by Robert Tappan Morris

    - first person to be arrested from felony conviction in US under 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse act

* meant to check for security flaws, but cause accidental fork bomb with reinfections

* spread by exploiting known vulnerabilies in:

    - Unix Sendmail 

    - rsh -- remote shellls

    - rexec -- berkeley r-commands

    - weak passwords

* infected 2000 computers within 15 hours

    - 6000 reported computers infected total -- 10% of the internet at the time

    - took 2 days to take off a single computer

## Cascade

* first malware to use a form of encryption

    - for keeping program undetected, not to harm user data


* Affected: Digital Equipment OS; .COM executables -- like .sh on Linux

    - intended to ignore IBM Computers, but infected anything


* Slowly made changes to your computer over time

* Signs of infection:

    - changed with variants or *mutations* of code

    - increase file sizes -- specifically 1704 bytes in most variants

    - first 3 bytes of host file added to first 3 bytes of virus's main file

    - would activate between October 1st and December 31st

    - makes text *fall* on the screen -- think winning solitaire

* possibly 40 different variants by some accounts
